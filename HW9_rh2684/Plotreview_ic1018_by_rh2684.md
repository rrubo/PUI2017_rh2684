## Plot review

**Plot**: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hong Kong Hourly Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) at different Air Quality Monitoring stations for October 2017<br>

### Clarity:

<p>
Isha visualized air quality health index measured hourly by Hong Kong's different monitoring stations. The strengths of the visualization are:
<ul>
<li>
Detailed title, that allows to understand what's happening on the plot
</li>
<li>
Great caption, though might be too detailed, describing the measurement scale and providing insights on stories behind the data
</li>
<li>
Measurement units of axes, which is important to read the visualization
</li>
<li>
The gradient additional scale, allowing to understand the meaning of colored cells
</li>
<li>
Color blindness check did not reveal any difficulties in reading the data, except of different coloring of the plot, which is not important in this case, since it is colored by using tones of one color 
</li>
</ul>
The only comment towards improvement in terms of clarity would be that the X-ticks and Y-ticks could be a bit bigger, for example font size being 18. As a person who wears glasses, I couldn't read the ticks without them, though I could read the rest of the text.<br><br>

Below is the caption of the plot written by Isha:

Figure 1: Color Map showing the Hong Kong Hourly Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) at different Air Quality Monitoring stations for October 2017. The AQHI is recorded by HK-Environmental Protection Department (HK). The AQHI informs the short-term health risk of air pollution and helps the people to take precautionary measures to protect their health.The AQHIs are reported on a scale of 1 to 10 (ranging from low risk to high risk). The darker the color of the grid, the higher is the AQHI and health-risk. The figure shows that AQHI is at its peak in the evening hours (4 to 8), as these are the times when people are going back home or travelling for leisure. As HK is a vibrant city specifically in the evening and night, it is usually very crowded in the evening and the night time. Places like Central and Causeway Bay (Causeway bay - also a very tourist - rich area) are central business district and partying areas, and hence are very crowded during the evening and night. Mong Kong is a shopping paradise and hence people usually go there in the evening. Tuen Mun and Tung Chung are shopping + residential areas, and people generally like to spend a lot of time outside during the evening.

### Esthethic:
<p>
From the esthetic point of view:
<ul>
<li>
Nice visualisation, color gradient allows to understand the changes of air pollution during different hours of a day
</li>
</ul>
</p>

### Honesty:

<p>
The visualisation represents the data quite good. The only concern that I have is that if I want to have the exact value of a cell, I might spend some time on matching the color of the cell with the gradient scale. Of course, the scale is quite precise, however, if I need more specific details, time needs to be spent (imagine the plot being printed using a bad, monochrome printer). <br><br>

**Overall**, I really like the visualization, and consider this a great analysis!
