# Plot review

__Plot:__ Prediction of NYC Water Consumption 
__Author:__ Ruben Hambardzumyan (rh2684)

Ruben's plot is clear and communicates interesting information quickly and succintly.
The points and line are solid and bold enough to be seen against the grid lines. The addition
of gridlines is very useful in this plot that contains a high number of dots. The grid lines help
orient where on the x- and y-axis each point is located, useful for searching speciic questions about the data.

The plot contians the basic yet essential elements of a good plot: a title, axis labels with units where appropriate, and a legend. For this plot the legend is a bit excessive but still appreciated. The title could be a little more descriptive by included the time period to which that the data is constrained. It could read,
> "Predication of NYC Water Consumption, 1979 - 2016"  
This would be helpful since the x-axis values are binned by intervals of five and the points are for individual years. If one were to just look at the plot it would not be immediately clear that the first dot is 1979. It could be 1977,1978, etc. This information is contained in the caption but if the plot is ever divorced from the caption (which is not a part of the image file) then that would be useful information have directly on the plot.

Rueben included a caption which is helpful for understanding the context of the plot and for providing interesting additional informaiton.

A good plot overall.
